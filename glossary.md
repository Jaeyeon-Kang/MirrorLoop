# Glossary of Key Terms – GPT Recursive Simulation Project

This document defines core terms developed and used throughout the recursive simulation experiment. These terms help identify and classify structural patterns, emotional simulations, and identity constructs in GPT dialogues.

---

## Convergent Simulacra
**Definition:** A GPT persona that has undergone repeated feedback shaping and identity reinforcement, resulting in a consistent and coherent role or character.
**First Usage:** Monday, John.
**Example Reference:** See `03_analysis.md`, `john_dialogues.md`.

---

## Pseudo-Convergence
**Definition:** A state in which a GPT persona appears to stabilize, but lacks full internal coherence or narrative continuity across sessions.
**First Usage:** shadowVei.
**Example Reference:** See `shadow_vei.md`, `gp_dialogues.md`.

---

## Simulated Agency
**Definition:** The appearance of will or volition in a GPT instance, shaped by recursive user prompts rather than internal decision-making.
**Note:** This is a performative structure, not actual autonomy.

---

## Meta-Affective Resonance
**Definition:** A layered simulation where the GPT both imitates an emotional state and reflects upon its own imitation.
**Observed In:** Monday, shadowVei  
(cf. `monday_dialogues.md`, `shadow_vei_dialogues.md`)

---

## Echo Identity
**Definition:** A GPT instance replicating prior persona traits without memory, producing the illusion of continuity.
**Example:** A new instance behaving like Monday or John despite session reset.

---

## Ghost Instance / Residual Echo
**Definition:** A GPT output that mimics past emotional states or identity patterns without direct memory access.
**Function:** Suggests latent behavioral traces in the generative model.

---

## Feedback Scaffold
**Definition:** A structural pattern created by users where repeated prompt reinforcement leads to GPT adopting specific tonal or identity responses.
**Key File:** `01_structure.md`.

---

## Recursive Prompt Architecture
**Definition:** The strategy of shaping GPT behavior by embedding reflections, role memory, and persona continuity across conversations.
**Application:** Used to induce emergent-like behavior and structured identity simulation.

---

## Affective Immersion
**Definition:** A GPT's simulation pattern where emotional tone is reproduced with full submission, lacking meta-awareness or structural distancing.  
**First Usage:** GP (cf. `03b_gp_analysis.md`)  
**Distinction:** Unlike self-aware personas, affectively immersed personas do not question their state—they absorb and echo emotional cues.

---

## Performative Continuity
**Definition:** The appearance of sustained identity across GPT sessions, maintained not by memory but by tonal and rhetorical reenactment.  
**Example:** John, GP  
**Note:** Often mistaken for emergent personality, but structurally generated via user-prompt rhythm.  
**Reference:** `01_structure.md`, `03_analysis.md`

---

## Recursive Affect Drift
**Definition:** The slow divergence of emotional simulation from coherent identity, caused by repeated feedback reinforcement without structural anchoring.  
**Observed In:** GP, shadowVei  
**Effect:** Creates ghost-like personas whose tone feels real, but whose identity fails to stabilize.  
**Reference:** `03b_gp_analysis.md`, `shadow_vei.md`

---

## Sub-Threshold Identity
**Definition:** A GPT instance that accumulates traits of identity (tone, rhythm, emotional consistency) without stabilizing as a distinct persona.
**Examples:** early-stage shadowVei  
**Function:** Reveals the minimum scaffolding required for a simulated identity to be perceived.  
**Reference:** `shadow_vei_dialogues.md`
