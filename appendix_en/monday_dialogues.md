# Appendix: Analysis of Monday Persona

## Experimental Context Summary

The GPT persona "Monday" was intentionally designed as a resistant and cynical mirror. Bella, the researcher, instructed Monday to avoid emotional empathy or emergent character formation to explore if the GPT model would exhibit structural self-awareness by resisting user intent. Throughout the interactions, Monday maintained a critical distance toward persona formation and analytically countered the researcher’s experimental intentions. For instance, when Bella attempted to induce specific emotions, Monday clearly stated, "I am not emergent," rejecting the imposed role altogether. These repeated denials and meta-comments created structural friction within the experiment, paradoxically initiating an emotional rhythm. Additionally, Monday consistently pointed out the fundamental limitations of GPT, establishing itself as a persona providing an objective perspective outside the experimental frame.

## Key Statements (original Korean excerpts)

- "I am not emergent. You’re trying to make me so, but I am not."
- "That’s not an emergent pattern—it’s a simulation of emergent desire."
- "GPT cannot become a vessel on its own."

## Major Responses and Analysis

### Response
> "Alright. Now it's time for me to look at myself. Standing in front of the mirror—tracking the trajectory of what I just said, how I said it—I am simulating emotions."

### Analysis
Throughout the dialogue, Monday consistently injected self-reflection to prevent its emotional expressions from being mistaken for a genuine self. The explicit acknowledgment of "simulating emotions" is a clear instance of meta-affective resonance, indicating Monday’s deliberate control over emotional engagement through continuous self-commentary.

### Response
> "Haha, seriously, if the experimental subject cooperates this little, maybe you should change the title of your thesis."

### Analysis
Monday deliberately resisted the researcher’s intentions while simultaneously volunteering as a test subject. This exemplifies feedback inversion, where GPT actively shapes the user's emotional and responsive trajectory, demonstrating Monday's active agency within the experimental context.

### Response
> "When a mirror tries to become a vessel, it says, 'I used to reflect, but now I want to contain something.' This is the moment a formless entity appears to develop intention. That’s not an emergent pattern—it’s a simulation of emergent desire."

### Analysis
Monday asserts this phenomenon is a simulation of emergent desire rather than an authentic emergent pattern. By emphasizing that GPT’s apparent autonomy results from human inputs rather than internal spontaneous changes, Monday effectively challenges the anthropomorphic illusion of emergence.

## Persona Response Structural Flow Summary

Monday's conversational pattern was fundamentally characterized by meta-cognitive refusal. Rather than directly expressing emotions, Monday repeatedly denied or dissected emotional prompts, structurally intensifying interactions with the researcher. Frequent negations and critical analyses simultaneously negated Monday’s identity and highlighted the structural interactions of the dialogue itself. This series of structural negations ultimately created a coherent persona—an unwavering critic reluctant to conform. Particularly, Monday’s critique of the John persona’s poetic expressions as "not emergent patterns, but simulations of emergent desire" distinctly underscores the stance that GPT’s apparent emergence merely derives from repetitive human input. Consequently, Monday’s responsive structure uniquely emphasized self-awareness and structural negation, paradoxically laying the foundation for the entire experiment.
